Transliterate
=============

A String to string parser built on combinator parsers.

The primary purpose of this parser tool is for building syntax highlighters but it has some other usefull features.

This is still in early stages, but as proof of concept works well.

Rather than building a tree when parsing, the result is put directly onto the output string.
